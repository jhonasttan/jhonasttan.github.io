The Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) program aims to significantly increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents receiving post secondary degrees in the computing disciplines. Initially, its emphasis will be on students from communities with longstanding underrepresentation in computing: women, persons with disabilities, and minorities. Included minorities are African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. The BPC program seeks to engage the computing community in developing and implementing innovative methods to improve recruitment and retention of these students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Because the lack of role models in the professoriate can be a barrier to participation, the BPC program also aims to develop effective strategies for identifying and supporting members of the targeted groups who want to pursue academic careers in computing.

The CISE Pathways to Revitalized Undergraduate Education in Computing (CPATH) program  also recognizes the growing importance of CT in society.  The goals of the program are to:
•	contribute to the development of a globally competitive U.S. workforce with CT competencies essential to U.S. leadership in the global innovation enterprise;
•	increase awareness of the strategic importance of undergraduate computing education in a wide range of career fields and disciplinary and interdisciplinary areas; 
•	identify and implement integrative new models for undergraduate computing education that are replicable across a variety of programs and institutions, and have a high probability of adoption on a national scale; 
•	increase the number of students developing CT competencies by infusing CT learning opportunities into undergraduate education in the core computing fields - computer and information science and engineering, and in other fields of study; and,
•	demonstrate transformative CT-focused undergraduate education models that are replicable across a variety of institutions.
CPATH seeks to identify and define the core computing concepts, methods, technologies and tools to be integrated into promising new undergraduate education models, and to demonstrate effective strategies to develop and assess CT competencies in the relevant learning communities.  While aimed primarily at revitalizing undergraduate education, CISE encourages the exploration of new models that extend from institutions of higher education into the K-12 environment; activities that engage K-12 teachers and students to facilitate the seamless transition of secondary students into CT-focused undergraduate programs are particularly encouraged.","2007",5,5,4.37,"General STEM",NA,"Institutional Capacity: Support advancement and development of STEM personnel, programs, and infrastructure in educational institutions such as universities, informal education institutions, state education agencies, and local education agencies",NA,NA,NA,"Post-Secondary STEM Degrees: Increase the number of students who enroll in STEM majors, complete STEM credentials or degree programs, or are prepared to enter STEM careers or advanced education",NA,NA,NA,"Education Research and Development: Develop evidence-based STEM education models and practices",NA,NA,NA,"Disciplinary Education Research and Development: Research and development interwoven to improve STEM learning and teaching, within a single STEM discipline or across specific disciplines (e.g. learning trajectories research)","Small-Scale Implementation: STEM education projects, techniques, models, resources, and/or technologies used with a relatively small group of learners or educators in one or several (<10) classrooms, museums, schools, etc.","Building Capacity of People or Organizations: Development of human and institutional capacity to develop, test, adapt and implement effective STEM education work",NA,"Basic/Foundational Education Research: Research on STEM learning, teaching, or education practices/materials/technology",NA,NA,NA,"Large Scale Deployment: STEM education projects, techniques, models, resources, and/or technologies implemented at the state, regional, or national scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Direct classroom instruction to students","Instructional material development",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Engagement in authentic STEM experience (including research)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Assessment implementation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Education Researchers",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Post-secondary instructors","Undergraduate Instructors (13-16)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No",NA,NA,NA,"No",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"National scope or not targeted to a geographic region","x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Science - Computer science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Four-year institutions of higher education (bachelor- and/or graduate-degree-granting institutions)","Two-year institutions of higher education or community colleges",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Professional societies",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Competitive (grants or contracts)",NA,NA,NA,"Don't know","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Encouraged","Four-year institutions of higher education (bachelor- and/or graduate-degree-granting institutions)","Two-year institution of higher education or community college","Minority institution (MI)","All types of Minority Institutions",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"School district or school",NA,"Professional society",NA,NA,NA,"Industry",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Number of K-12 schools served","Number of K-12 schools served",NA,"Number institutions of higher education served",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Other","courses and modules created, higher education programs created","NONE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"evaluator-developed instruments",NA,NA,"YES","INDEPENDENT",NA,NA,"INDEPENDENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NO",NA,NA,"NO",NA,NA

GEO-Teach awardees are expected to assume a leadership role in the geoscience 
education community by facilitating widespread collaborative efforts to 
implement high quality educational practices.

GEO-Teach projects are expected to be designed to:
 * provide teachers with easy access to high-quality curricular materials, 
 * broadly implement high quality pre-service teacher training programs and 
in-service professional development opportunities.

GEO-Teach projects should emphasize the importance of an Earth system science 
approach in geoscience education and should promote the integration of content 
drawn from atmospheric science, Earth science, and ocean science disciplines. 
The relevance of the geosciences to modern society should be made clear by 
GEO-Teach products and activities.

The GEO-Teach program is expected to have a transformative effect on geoscience 
education. GEO-Teach projects should take a leadership role in the geoscience

coordinated national network of regionally- or thematically-based partnerships 
devoted to increasing the adoption of effective, high quality educational 
programs and resources related to the science of climate change and its 
impacts. Each CCEP is required to be of a large enough scale that they will 
have catalytic or transformative impact that cannot be achieved through other 
core NSF program awards. The CCEP program is one facet of a larger NSF 
collection of awards related to Climate Change Education (CCE) that has two 
goals: (1) preparing a new generation of climate scientists, engineers, and 
technicians equipped to provide innovative and creative approaches to 
understanding global climate change and to mitigate its impact; and, (2) 
preparing today's U.S. citizens to understand global climate change and its 
implications in ways that can lead to informed, evidence-based responses and 
solutions. 

Each CCEP must include representation from at least each of the following 
communities: climate scientists, experts in the learning sciences, and 
practitioners from within formal or informal education venues. This combined 
expertise will insure that educational programs and resources developed through 
the activities of each CCEP reflects current understanding about climate 
science, the best theoretical approaches for teaching such a complex topic, and 
the practical means necessary to reach the intended learner audience(s). 

Each CCEP is organized around either geographic regions that share similar 
climate change impacts, or major climate impact themes (e.g., sealevel rise).

The CCEP program is a two-phase program. The development of Phase I
Partnerships (CCEP-I) was initiated in FY 2010. CCEP-I grantees have received 2 
years of funding to support synthesis, networkbuilding,
and strategic planning activities leading toward potential Phase II 
Partnerships (CCEP-II). Each CCEP-I awardee is expected to: (1) conduct an 
inventory of existing climate change education resources and identify
educational needs and opportunities relevant to their particular region or 
theme; (2) identify key players from relevant stakeholder communities and 
initiate network development; (3) convene community workshops and other 
community-building activities that lead toward development of a comprehensive 
climate change education strategic plan for that Partnership; and, (4) begin to 
serve as a test-bed for development, customization and scaling up of 
standards-based instructional materials, professional development and training 
models, and other appropriate
activities tailored to the Partnership's goals. External evaluation activities 
(formative and summative) are required during Phase I efforts (and will be 
required during Phase II).","2009",0,9.95,10.24,"General STEM",NA,"Learning: Develop STEM skills, practices, or knowledge of students or the public",NA,"Engagement: Increase learners’ engagement, interest in STEM and their perception of its value to their lives, or their ability or participate in STEM","Pre and In Service Educator/Education Leader Performance: Train or retain STEM educators (K-12 pre-service or in-service, post-secondary, and informal) and education leaders to improve the content knowledge and pedagogical skills of STEM educators","Post-Secondary STEM Degrees: Increase the number of students who enroll in STEM majors, complete STEM credentials or degree programs, or are prepared to enter STEM careers or advanced education","STEM Careers: Prepare people to enter STEM workforce with training or certification (where STEM discipline specific knowledge and skill are the primary focus of the education investment; STEM educator training and development investments should select the Pre and In Service Educator/Education Leader Performance objective listed above)","Institutional Capacity: Support advancement and development of STEM personnel, programs, and infrastructure in educational institutions such as universities, informal education institutions, state education agencies, and local education agencies","STEM System Reform: Improve STEM education through a focus on education system reform","Education Research and Development: Develop evidence-based STEM education models and practices",NA,NA,"Basic/Foundational Education Research: Research on STEM learning, teaching, or education practices/materials/technology","Disciplinary Education Research and Development: Research and development interwoven to improve STEM learning and teaching, within a single STEM discipline or across specific disciplines (e.g. learning trajectories research)",NA,"Building Capacity of People or Organizations: Development of human and institutional capacity to develop, test, adapt and implement effective STEM education work","Large Scale Deployment: STEM education projects, techniques, models, resources, and/or technologies implemented at the state, regional, or national scale",NA,NA,"Small-Scale Implementation: STEM education projects, techniques, models, resources, and/or technologies used with a relatively small group of learners or educators in one or several (<10) classrooms, museums, schools, etc.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Instructional material development","Online education resource sites (e.g., online digital libraries)",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Engagement in authentic STEM experience (including research)","Learning program (i.e., after-school, weekend, or summer program)",NA,"Training or professional development",NA,"Education research to improve STEM teaching and learning","Implementation of assessment","Development of assessment",NA,"Administrative support",NA,NA,"Pre-K-20 learners",NA,"Elementary school (K-5) aged learners","Middle school (6-8) aged learners","High school (9-12) aged learners","Undergraduate school (13-16) aged learners",NA,"K-12 classroom teachers","Pre-service-service",NA,"Elementary (K-5)","Middle (6-8)","High (9-12)","In-service",NA,"Elementary (K-5)","Middle (6-8)","High (9-12)","Adult learners (other than educators, education leaders, education researchers, or policy makers)","Education Researchers","K-12 staff/leaders/administrators",NA,"Elementary (K-5)","Middle School (6-8)","High School (9-12)","Post-secondary instructors","Undergraduate Instructors (13-16)","Graduate Instructors (17-20)",NA,"Post-secondary deans/leaders/administrators","Undergraduate","Graduate","Post Graduate","Informal STEM educators",NA,NA,NA,"No",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No",NA,NA,NA,"No",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"National scope or not targeted to a geographic region","x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Science - Earth, atmospheric, ocean, or planetary science",NA,"Science - Environmental science",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Other","Climate is very interdisciplinary and spans the natural and social sciences.","Federally funded research and development centers, experimental stations, other federal STEM research facilities (e.g., marine sanctuaries)",NA,"Four-year institutions of higher education (bachelor- and/or graduate-degree-granting institutions)",NA,"State systems of higher education","State education agency or state government",NA,"Informal education institutions or organizations","Professional societies","Grants to STEM professionals or companies (e.g., education researchers, evaluation companies, non-federal STEM research labs)",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Competitive (grants or contracts)",NA,NA,NA,"Don't know",NA,"NASA","0.05",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Required",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Other","Partnerships among climate scientists, learning scientists, and education

"19","PRG_0020","Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)","National Science Foundation","Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR)","The REU program supports active participation by undergraduate students in 
research projects in all areas of research funded by NSF. The program seeks to 
involve students in meaningful ways in all kinds of research -- whether 
disciplinary, interdisciplinary, or educational in focus -- linked to the 
efforts of individual investigators, research groups, centers, and national 
facilities. The program employs two mechanisms for involving students in 
research: (1) REU SITES engage a cohort of students (at least six, but usually 
more) in research in a single discipline or academic department, or in 
interdisciplinary or multi-department research that has a coherent intellectual 
theme. Most commonly, REU Sites operate for 8-10 weeks during the summer, but some Sites operate during the academic year. (2) REU SUPPLEMENTS to existing grants or cooperative agreements, or as a component of new (or renewal) research proposals, allow investigators to add a small number of students (usually one or two) to their NSF-funded research projects.

The REU program contributes to NSF's efforts to educate and prepare a diverse, 
world-class science and engineering workforce. NSF is particularly interested 
in increasing the numbers of women, underrepresented minorities, and persons 
with disabilities in research, and REU projects are strongly encouraged to 
involve students who are members of these groups. Another goal of the program 
is to involve students in research who might not otherwise have the 
opportunity, particularly those from academic institutions where research 
programs are limited. The program requires each REU Site to select a 
significant fraction of its student participants from outside the host 
institution.

REU projects typically feature high-quality interaction of students with 
faculty and other research mentors, as well as activities that enhance 
students' understanding of the research process, their understanding of 
pathways to careers and graduate school in science and engineering, and their 
writing and presentation skills.","1987",62.67,100.47,80.99,"General STEM",NA,"STEM Careers",NA,NA,NA,"Post-Secondary STEM Degrees: Increase the number of students who enroll in STEM majors, complete STEM credentials or degree programs, or are prepared to enter STEM careers or advanced education",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Other","Provide training opportunities for undergraduate students in STEM fields",NA,NA,NA,"Building Capacity of People or Organizations: Development of human and institutional capacity to develop, test, adapt and implement effective STEM education work",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Basic/Foundational Education Research: Research on STEM learning, teaching, or education practices/materials/technology","Disciplinary Education Research and Development: Research and development interwoven to improve STEM learning and teaching, within a single STEM discipline or across specific disciplines (e.g. learning trajectories research)","Small-Scale Implementation: STEM education projects, techniques, models, resources, and/or technologies used with a relatively small group of learners or educators in one or several (<10) classrooms, museums, schools, etc.",NA,"Large Scale Deployment: STEM education projects, techniques, models, resources, and/or technologies implemented at the state, regional, or national scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Engagement in authentic STEM experience (including research)",NA,NA,"Training or professional development",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pre-K-20 learners",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Undergraduate school (13-16) aged learners",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Post-secondary instructors","Undergraduate Instructors (13-16)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yes","U.S. citizens","Permanent residents",NA,"No",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"National scope or not targeted to a geographic region","x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"STEM (no specific subject or field required)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Federally funded research and development centers, experimental stations, other federal STEM research facilities (e.g., marine sanctuaries)",NA,"Four-year institutions of higher education (bachelor- and/or graduate-degree-granting institutions)",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Informal education institutions or organizations",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Competitive (grants or contracts)",NA,NA,NA,"Don't know",NA,"DOD","4.5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mixed",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Number institutions of higher education served",NA,NA,"Number institutions of higher education served",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Other","Number of undergraduates who participate in research experiences sponsored by

The core of the activity is long-term research experiences for interdisciplinarily balanced cohorts of at least four undergraduates. Projects should focus on research at the intersection of the mathematical and biological sciences. Projects should provide students exposure to contemporary mathematics and biology, addressed with modern research tools and methods. That is, projects must be genuine research experiences rather than rehearsals of research methods. Projects must involve students from both areas in collaborative research experiences and include joint mentorship by faculty in both fields. In addition, it is expected that projects will strengthen the research and education capacity, infrastructure, and culture of the participating institutions. To this end, projects should create models for education in the mathematical and biological sciences and influence the direction of academic programs for a broad range of students.

The JPFP is funded by NASA and jointly administered by UNCF Special Programs Corporation (UNCFSP). The project selects 20 new fellows per year for three-year awards and supports up to 60 fellows annually. For ten consecutive years, JPFP has employed a holistic approach to graduate student preparation by successfully addressing the need  to provide financial support,  mentoring and professional development training  during the graduate school 
experience. The JPFP also provides hands on research experiences for each Fellow at NASA Centers. This holistic approach, coupled with professional development training, undoubtedly makes the JPFP one of the most unique and competitive graduate fellowship programs available.
The program currently has five main goals:

1. To develop U.S. science, technology, and engineering expertise in ethnic and 
gender groups that are currently underrepresented in the STEM workforce;  

2. To offset financial barriers for students underrepresented in STEM fields 
pursuing a graduate education;

3. To provide hands-on research experiences at NASA Centers;  

4. To expose students to the salient aspects of professional and career 
development;

The program targets ""at risk"" (minority and low socio-economic) students and utilizes instruction modules specifically designed to meet specific STEM objectives. The elementary school program is currently designed to reach students at the fifth grade level that are underrepresented in the STEM areas of study and careers. Students attend 4 or 5 days and are engaged through an inquiry-based curriculum with ""hands-on, minds-on"" experiential activities. Students apply Newton’s laws and Bernoulli’s principles as they study the wonders of space and properties of matter. Technology and its problem-solving techniques are utilized with computers in experiments, in design of all terrain and space vehicles. Math is embedded throughout the curriculum and teamwork and goal setting are a constant theme as students work together to explore, explain, elaborate and evaluate concepts. The DoD STARBASE mentoring program has been designed as a team mentoring model applying best practices from the mentoring field to the DoD STARBASE Program operating environment. In partnership with local school districts, the middle school and high school program is an after school STEM mentoring program that combines STEM activities with a relationship-rich, school-based environment to provide the missing link for at-risk youth making the transition from elementary to middle school, and from middle school to high school. It extends the positive impact of STARBASE through a team mentoring approach which solidifies students’ attachment to and engagement with school. Mentoring clubs are expected to meet no less than four hours per month. The DoD STARBASE Program is a productive investment in the future of our youth and will help build and enlarge the talent pool of potential workers needed to support the DoD workforce consisting of civilian and military personnel.","1993",20,19,20,"General STEM",NA,"Engagement: Increase learners’ engagement, interest in STEM and their perception of its value to their lives, or their ability or participate in STEM","Learning: Develop STEM skills, practices, or knowledge of students or the public",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"STEM System Reform: Improve STEM education through a focus on education system reform",NA,"Other","help build and enlarge the talent pool of potential workers needed to support the DoD workforce cons",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Large Scale Deployment: STEM education projects, techniques, models, resources, and/or technologies implemented at the state, regional, or national scale","Basic/Foundational Education Research: Research on STEM learning, teaching, or education practices/materials/technology","Disciplinary Education Research and Development: Research and development interwoven to improve STEM learning and teaching, within a single STEM discipline or across specific disciplines (e.g. learning trajectories research)",NA,"Building Capacity of People or Organizations: Development of human and institutional capacity to develop, test, adapt and implement effective STEM education work",NA,NA,NA,"Small-Scale Implementation: STEM education projects, techniques, models, resources, and/or technologies used with a relatively small group of learners or educators in one or several (<10) classrooms, museums, schools, etc.",NA,NA,"Direct classroom instruction to students","Instructional material development",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Engagement in authentic STEM experience (including research)","Learning program (i.e., after-school, weekend, or summer program)","Tutoring, mentoring, or other learner support","Training or professional development",NA,NA,"Implementation of assessment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pre-K-20 learners",NA,NA,"Middle school (6-8) aged learners","High school (9-12) aged learners",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yes","x",NA,"Hispanic or Latino","Black or African American","Native Hawaiian / Other Pacific Islander","American Indian / Alaska Native","Economically disadvantaged","Female",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Other","Asian","No",NA,NA,NA,"No",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"National scope or not targeted to a geographic region","x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Science - Physical sciences (including physics, chemistry, astronomy, materials science)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Technology (no specific subject or field required)","Engineering (no specific subject or field required)","Mathematics or statistics","Other","STEM Careers, Teamwork",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Encouraged",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"School district or school",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Federally funded research and development center, experimental station, or other federal STEM research facility (e.g. marine sanctuaries)","Industry","Non-profit Organization",NA,NA,NA,"Number of learners (any age) served","Number of learners (any age) served","Number of educators served",NA,"Number of K-12 schools served","Number of K-12 schools served","Number of school districts served",NA,NA,"Hours of tutoring, mentoring, or other service provided","Number of contact hours by audience","Hours of tutoring, mentoring, or other service provided",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Learner performance (e.g., attendance, test scores, pass rates, achieving selected performance levels, or grade point average)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Other","Program participant satisfication","self-testing and evaluation","outside the organization-evaluators",NA,"YES","INDEPENDENT","INTERNAL",NA,"INDEPENDENT","INTERNAL",NA,"INDEPENDENT","INTERNAL",NA,NA,NA,"NO","INDEPENDENT",NA

The design of HSLS:09 is similar to its predecessor studies but with the 
following changes:  1) HSLS:09 is the first NCES-sponsored longitudinal 
study to begin with a ninth-grade cohort; 2) All surveys and the adaptive 
assessment are administered via computer; 3) School counselor input into 
students’ decision-making about courses and postsecondary choices was 
collected; 4) The mathematics assessment developed specifically for HSLS:09 
focuses on algebra skills critical to success in secondary and postsecondary 
education; and 5) NCES staff who have expertise in the secondary school to

Grants that target community health care providers or community settings arc intended to provide information needed to facilitate (he diffusion of evidence-based findings within a relatively short time. The programs, which have been proposed for Cancer Education giants, may use a variety of formats, depending upon both target audiences and specific goals. Giants that are aimed at educating students, cancer scientists, cancer care professionals, clinicians, and/or community health provide may develop and use primarily curriculum-based short-term educational experiences. Program delivery to the targeted audience(s) may take place in traditional educational settings or via web-based and other virtual approaches. Curriculum content may range from cancer biology and genetics to cancer prevention, control, and palliative care.

Research dissemination grants target public health workers, community organization partners, and clinicians who need the knowledge and tools to both implement and disseminate information about cancer prevention and control programs into patient and lay community populations. Applications proposing cancer research dissemination projects must be based on solid, rigorous, and up-to-date cancer research and should involve defined schemes for the dissemination of relevant knowledge and information. Consequently, these grants should link proposed education and dissemination activities to knowledge-transfer approaches such as research-practice partnership models (e.g., community-based or clinic-based participatory research, Push-Pull-Infrastructure models, diffusion of innovation models, expanding intervention reach models and virtual approaches research dissemination (e.g., Cancer Control PLANET, http://cancercontrolplanct.cancer.gov), an NCI web portal that provides evidence based tools to cancer control planners and interventionists).

Early in its history, Sea Grant provided an emphasis on K-12 education by developing marine and aquatic sciences education curricula and professional development programs for pre-college teachers. Current Sea Grant Educators Network (SGEN) efforts continue to provide pre-college teachers with enhanced science content knowledge, instructional skills, and high-quality curricula for teaching their students about the relevance of watersheds, coastal processes, and marine and aquatic sciences.
Although it wasn’t until 1998 that the SGEN became formally organized, Sea Grant educators and the National Sea Grant Office (NSGO) have a long history of identifying and implementing major national partnerships and funding opportunities. This network of professional educators, working in partnership with the NSGO, supports the core of Sea Grant education activity. These individuals have experience—and a proven track record—in multidisciplinary marine and aquatic sciences education for the formal and informal education sectors. Over the years, they have established links among pre-college teachers, students, informal educators and the coastal, ocean, and Great Lakes research communities. Today, the SGEN:
• Offers a diversity of innovative and traditional approaches to marine and aquatic sciences education.
• Integrates information technology into program delivery.
• Can identify and develop plans of action to respond to current issues and trends in the marine and aquatic sciences education community.
• Provides a suite of multidisciplinary programs and can draw on a variety of expertise to develop solutions for specific opportunities.

Research Reserves serve as ""living classrooms"" for educators, students and the public in general. Since 1972, the Research Reserves have been federally mandated to promote education at 28 reserves located in 22 states and Puerto Rico. NERRS takes a local approach in advancing estuary literacy and generating meaningful experiences for all kinds of people interested in learning about, protecting and restoring estuaries. Through integrated research and education, the reserves help communities develop strategies to deal successfully with various coastal resource issues. Reserves provide adult audiences with training on estuarine issues of concern in their local communities; classes for K-12 students; teacher professional development programs; and public education events. The Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF) program provides master’s degree students and Ph.D. candidates with an opportunity to conduct research of local and national significance that focuses on enhancing coastal zone management. The NERRS Education Program provides place-based educational experiences that facilitate hands-on exploration of estuary environments, enhances the capacity and skills of teachers and students to understand and use NERRS data, and promotes active stewardship of estuaries and coastal watersheds.","1976",2.82,3.501562,4.00183,"General STEM",NA,"Learning: Develop STEM skills, practices, or knowledge of students or the public",NA,"Engagement: Increase learners’ engagement, interest in STEM and their perception of its value to their lives, or their ability or participate in STEM","Pre and In Service Educator/Education Leader Performance: Train or retain STEM educators (K-12 pre-service or in-service, post-secondary, and informal) and education leaders to improve the content knowledge and pedagogical skills of STEM educators","Post-Secondary STEM Degrees: Increase the number of students who enroll in STEM majors, complete STEM credentials or degree programs, or are prepared to enter STEM careers or advanced education",NA,"Institutional Capacity: Support advancement and development of STEM personnel, programs, and infrastructure in educational institutions such as universities, informal education institutions, state education agencies, and local education agencies","STEM System Reform: Improve STEM education through a focus on education system reform",NA,"Other","The NERRS Mission is to practice and promote stewardship of coasts and estuaries through innovative research, education, and training using a place-based system of protected areas.

Our education goals and objectives encompass a focus that goes beyond STEM. As stated in Section 315 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended CZMA, 16 U.S.C. 1461, National Estuarine Research Reserves are federally designated ""to enhance public awareness and understanding of estuarine areas, and provide suitable opportunities for public education and interpretation."" In addition, and in accordance to the NERRS 2011-2016 Strategic Plan, the NERRS Education Program aims to advance the following objectives:

• Enhance the capacity and skills of teachers and students to understand and use NERRS data and information for inquiry-based learning.
• Increase estuary literacy and promote active stewardship among public audiences through the development and delivery of tools and programs addressing climate change, habitat protection, and water quality.
• Improve the capacity and skills of coastal decision makers to use and apply science-based information in decisions that affect estuaries and coastal watersheds. 

In particular, the Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF) Program, established in 1997, provides master’s degree students and Ph.D. candidates with an opportunity to conduct research of local and national significance that focuses on enhancing coastal zone management. Fellows engage with reserve staff members to contribute to their host reserves’ research and/or monitoring, stewardship, education, or coastal training programs, while gaining hands-on skills to complement their academic studies. Fellowship projects enhance scientific understanding of reserve ecosystems, provide information needed by reserve managers and coastal management decision-makers, and improve public awareness of estuarine ecosystems and estuarine management issues.

Such a center prepares individuals with transportation skills for career service in the functional areas of transportation in which it specializes.

A Center develops and implements transportation programs within a theme best suited for it to make the most significant contribution to the transportation community in its particular region, and in some cases, nationally. The theme provides the overall direction necessary to focus resources in the most effective way.

As the program matures, each center further focuses its effort to build expertise and achieve excellence so that the center can become a national resource in a particular area of transportation.

The purposes of the education element of the program are to build upon the strengths of existing programs at the Centers, create new innovative programs, expand graduate level transportation education in the United States, and increase the opportunities for new entrants into the field of transportation.

The purpose of the research element is to identify and conduct high quality research that will foster significant advances in transportation science and technology and generate basic, fundamental and applied knowledge in the appropriate disciplines.

The purpose of the technology transfer element is to ensure that the results of the research program are widely disseminated, applied, implemented and utilized. This effort requires close interaction between the universities and the entire transportation community. Each university will use its Center Advisory Committee to strengthen linkages to the transportation community its region and obtain feedback on regional problems and issues.

A fundamental goal of the program is to establish close linkages between education and research activities. These linkages occur through carefully designed programs that provide continuing opportunities for faculty and students to interact in the classroom and on research projects. The outputs of the research programs have direct and indirect applications to the educational activities.","1990",13.2,14.1,16.4,"Agency Mission Workforce",NA,"Post-Secondary STEM Degrees: Increase the number of students who enroll in STEM majors, complete STEM credentials or degree programs, or are prepared to enter STEM careers or advanced education",NA,NA,NA,NA,"STEM Careers: Prepare people to enter STEM workforce with training or certification (where STEM discipline specific knowledge and skill are the primary focus of the education investment; STEM educator training and development investments should select the Pre and In Service Educator/Education Leader Performance objective listed above)",NA,NA,NA,"Other","Aviation research",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Instructional material development",NA,NA,NA,"Recognition awards",NA,"Engagement in authentic STEM experience (including research)",NA,"Tutoring, mentoring, or other learner support","Training or professional development",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Infrastructure support","Administrative support",NA,NA,"Grades 6-20 aged learners",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Undergraduate (13-16)","Graduate (17-20)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Post-secondary deans/leaders/administrators","Undergraduate (13-16)","Graduate (17-20)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Other","Aviation and space-related enginnering, math and science.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Number of learners (any age) served","Number of learners (any age) served","Number of educators served",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Number of degrees or certificates earned",NA,NA,"none",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The amount of the SMART Grant, when combined with a Pell Grant, may not exceed the student's cost of attendance. In addition, if the number of eligible students is large enough that payment of the full grant amounts would exceed the program appropriation in any fiscal year, then the amount of the grant to each eligible student may be ratably reduced.
