Technology<br>
<br>
Who would have thought that by the ending of my first month of bootcamp
at the NYC Data Science Academy that I would have produced a Shiny
application that solves a business problem? Well, I didn't! So yes, I
am the most surprised on the solution I was able to create using Shiny
technology. I will be honest, present state Shiny is robust, but I
believe the coding syntax requires further simplification before the
programming aspect becomes as smooth as Python programmig. Only then I
believe, the learning curve will be reduced, making Shiny a great
alternative for rapid prototyping of web based solutions. <br>
<br>
What is the Problem?<br>
<br>
As a non subscriber of NYC , I have been fascinated with the number of
people riding bikes daily in NYC to and from work. I asked a few
citibike subscribers about their experience, and yes, some include
dealing with a pothole or two; therefore, was interested in the
logistics. My experience with the NYC Citibike Station Map website led
me to think about how do users determine if there will be bikes at a
given station, and will there be enough bike docks at their
destination? The site's station locate feature allows you to enter one
address, with an instant popup on the map displaying the number of
available bikes and docks. However, I felt this point was only the
start. A feature that allows me to determine bike / dock availability
at the station / destination with trip duration would allow me to plan
my route, with possible routing alternatives, if the duration of the
trip may result in a surcharge.&nbsp; I spoke with a few members of my
cohort, my&nbsp; instructor Chris and some external peers to confirm
the pursuit of a solution for this case was worthwhile.<br>
<br>
My cohort peer referred me to a great article that was mentioned by a
guest speaker (Andy Eschobar) that provided a detailed analysis on
Citibike ridership.<br>
